Data Guacamole
=====
First, I construct a simple meta-guacamole data gastronomification.

1. Search for the prices of guacamole ingredients in different places.
2. Vary a guacamole recipe based on the different prices.

In the above example, we happen to use guacamole to gastronomify the prices
of guacamole ingredients, but we could use it to gastronomify other data.
The next example uses the guacamole paradigm to gastromify treasury data.
Instead of the prices of tomatoes, avacodo, &c., we use the daily change in
balance for the ... accounts, respectively, of the US federal treasury.

The supermarket API doesn't have prices. Darn.

Here's a guacamole recipe [from the Food Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/guacamole-recipe/index.html)

* 3 Haas avocados, halved, seeded and peeled
* 1 lime, juiced
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
* 1/2 medium onion, diced
* 1/2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
* 2 Roma tomatoes, seeded and diced
* 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro
* 1 clove garlic, minced
