Data Guacamole
=====
First, I construct a simple meta-guacamole data gastronomification.

1. Search for the prices of guacamole ingredients in different places.
2. Vary a guacamole recipe based on the different prices.

In the above example, we happen to use guacamole to gastronomify the prices
of guacamole ingredients, but we could use it to gastronomify other data.
The next example uses the guacamole paradigm to gastromify treasury data.
Instead of the prices of tomatoes, avacodo, &c., we use the daily change in
balance for the ... accounts, respectively, of the US federal treasury.
